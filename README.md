## Technical info

This rest backend project is a Maven project using Spring boot and persisting to a Mongo database.

### Prerequisits

Application expects a mongod service running, i.e. "mongo" command is available and connects to database.

Mongod can be run by command "mongod â€“-dbpath <dbPath>"

### Running the application

Application can be run as a spring boot application in a IDE.

If the project is build via "mvm clean install", the jar can be run with its embedded tomcat server via command "java -jar culturelog-rest.jar".

In both cases, the start REST url is http://localhost:8080/api . 
The url can be configured by changing parameters "server.port" or "server.contextPath" in application.properties file 
or add them as startup parameters ("java -jar culturelog-rest.jar --server.port=8081").

The application will connect to or create a mongo database with name "culturelog". 
This name can be configured by the property "spring.data.mongodb.database" in application.properties file.

### Security

Login/password security is used.
